### How to devise an algorithm
- understand the problem
- identify approach
- step by step plan
- pseudocode or flowcharts
***
### How to validate algorithms
- Apply logical reasoning
- Counduct dry runs
- Evaluate proof of correctness	
***
### How to analyze an algorithm
- Time complexity
- Space complexity
- Big 'O Notation
***
### How to test an algorithm
- Test case creation
- Automate testing
- BenchMarking
***
```mmd
graph LR
	devise --> validate --> analyze --> test
```
